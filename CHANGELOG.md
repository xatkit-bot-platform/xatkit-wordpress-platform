## Unreleased

### Changed

- `RestProvider` now uses the new intent provider hierarchy (see [xatkit-runtime/#221](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit-runtime/issues/221)). This doesn't change the public API, but requires to use the latest version of [xatkit-runtime](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit-runtime).

## [2.0.0] - 2019-08-20
